I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.  It is very romantic to be in love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Then the excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.", "characters": 351, "sentences": 10}, {"text": "Jack.  I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.

Why on earth do you say that?", "characters": 36, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Algernon.  Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.

Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more than usually hard up.", "characters": 87, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Jack.

Of course it's mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.", "characters": 221, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Algernon.  Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn't.  More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.", "characters": 177, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Jack.  I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss modern culture.  It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in private.  I simply want my cigarette case back.", "characters": 181, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Algernon.  Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.

Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.", "characters": 63, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Jack.  Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy.", "characters": 101, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Algernon.

Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.  You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!  That is absurd!  For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows Algernon round the room.]", "characters": 388, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Algernon.  Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  'From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.'  There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can't quite make out.

You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look as if your name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest.  It's on your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it from case.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'  I'll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.

Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.", "characters": 118, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.", "characters": 202, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Jack.  My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist.  It produces a false impression.", "characters": 164, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Algernon.  Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.  Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing.  I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.", "characters": 218, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Jack.  Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?", "characters": 61, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Algernon.  I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.", "characters": 169, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Jack.  Well, produce my cigarette case first.", "characters": 45, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]", "characters": 124, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Jack.  My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.  In fact it's perfectly ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.", "characters": 442, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Algernon.  Where is that place in the country, by the way?", "characters": 58, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Jack.  That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited . . . I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.", "characters": 140, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Algernon.  I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?", "characters": 175, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Jack.  My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.  You are hardly serious enough.  When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.  It's one's duty to do so.  And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.  That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.", "characters": 586, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Algernon.  The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!", "characters": 155, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Jack.  That wouldn't be at all a bad thing.", "characters": 43, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don't try it.  You should leave that to people who haven't been at a University.  They do it so well in the daily papers.  What you really are is a Bunburyist.  I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.  You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.", "characters": 331, "sentences": 9}, {"text": "Jack.  What on earth do you mean?", "characters": 33, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Algernon.  You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.  I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.  If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to- night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.", "characters": 514, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Jack.  I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.", "characters": 61, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.  It is very foolish of you.  Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.", "characters": 165, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Jack.  You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.", "characters": 55, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.  To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one's own relations.  In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.  In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.  She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.  That is not very pleasant.  Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.  The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the rules.", "characters": 932, "sentences": 17}, {"text": "Jack.  I'm not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I'll kill him in any case.  Cecily is a little too much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I am going to get rid of Ernest.  And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.", "characters": 348, "sentences": 12}, {"text": "Algernon.  Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.", "characters": 238, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Jack.  That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won't want to know Bunbury.", "characters": 175, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Algernon.  Then your wife will.  You don't seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.", "characters": 114, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Jack.  [Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.", "characters": 143, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Algernon.  Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.", "characters": 76, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Jack.  For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical.  It's perfectly easy to be cynical.", "characters": 86, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Algernon.  My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays.  There's such a lot of beastly competition about.  [The sound of an electric bell is heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis's?", "characters": 414, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Jack.  I suppose so, if you want to.", "characters": 36, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are not serious about meals.  It is so shallow of them.", "characters": 124, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Lane.  Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.", "characters": 39, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "[Algernon goes forward to meet them.

Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.", "characters": 82, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.", "characters": 47, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Lady Bracknell.  That's not quite the same thing.  In fact the two things rarely go together.

[To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!", "characters": 51, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Gwendolen.  I am always smart!  Am I not, Mr. Worthing?", "characters": 55, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Jack.  You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.", "characters": 42, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Gwendolen.  Oh! I hope I am not that.

I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.  I hadn't been there since her poor husband's death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.  And now I'll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.", "characters": 325, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Algernon.  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.

Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.", "characters": 60, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Algernon.  [Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.", "characters": 134, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Lane.  [Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.

That will do, Lane, thank you.", "characters": 41, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Lane.  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]", "characters": 35, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Algernon.  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.", "characters": 107, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Lady Bracknell.  It really makes no matter, Algernon.  I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.", "characters": 149, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Algernon.  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.", "characters": 60, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Lady Bracknell.  It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I, of course, cannot say.  [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you. I've quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.  I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.  She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.  It's delightful to watch them.", "characters": 331, "sentences": 10}, {"text": "Algernon.  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.", "characters": 113, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Lady Bracknell.  [Frowning.]  I hope not, Algernon.  It would put my table completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that.", "characters": 169, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Algernon.  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.  [Exchanges glances with Jack.]  They seem to think I should be with him.", "characters": 258, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Lady Bracknell.  It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.", "characters": 97, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Algernon.  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.", "characters": 51, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Lady Bracknell.  Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Health is the primary duty of life.  I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.  I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.", "characters": 922, "sentences": 16}, {"text": "Algernon.

[Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A hundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.

[To Cecily.]  Come over here, dear.  [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.  But we can soon alter all that.

Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.

That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty- five is a very attractive age.

To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which was many years ago now.
