I quite understand, dear.", "characters": 37, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have suffered.

No, no; I want to hear about you.", "characters": 45, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. No, you must begin. I mustn't be selfish today; today I must only think of your affairs.

No, what is it?", "characters": 27, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Just fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!", "characters": 63, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. Your husband? What good luck!", "characters": 41, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Yes, tremendous! A barrister's profession is such an uncertain thing, especially if he won't undertake unsavoury cases; and naturally Torvald has never been willing to do that, and I quite agree with him. You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work in the Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of commissions. For the future we can live quite differently--we can do just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy, Christine! It will be splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won't it?", "characters": 565, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde.

You too?", "characters": 20, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Yes; odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery, and that kind of thing. (Dropping her voice.) And other things as well. You know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no prospect of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than before. But during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he had to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he couldn't stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was necessary for him to go south.", "characters": 529, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. You spent a whole year in Italy, didn't you?", "characters": 56, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's life. But it cost a tremendous lot of money, Christine.", "characters": 241, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. So I should think.", "characters": 30, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. It cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That's a lot, isn't it?", "characters": 73, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. Yes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the money.", "characters": 76, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. I ought to tell you that we had it from papa.", "characters": 51, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. Oh, I see. It was just about that time that he died, wasn't it?", "characters": 75, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn't go and nurse him. I was expecting little Ivar's birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald to look after. My dear, kind father--I never saw him again, Christine. That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.", "characters": 269, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. I know how fond you were of him. And then you went off to Italy?", "characters": 76, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our going, so we started a month later.", "characters": 105, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. And your husband came back quite well?", "characters": 50, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. As sound as a bell!", "characters": 25, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde.

I thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just as I did, was the doctor?", "characters": 98, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn't come here professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once everyday. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since then, and our children are strong and healthy and so am I. (Jumps up and claps her hands.) Christine! Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!--But how horrid of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. (Sits on a stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.) You mustn't be angry with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your husband? Why did you marry him?", "characters": 575, "sentences": 9}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless, and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I was justified in refusing his offer.", "characters": 177, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time, then?", "characters": 71, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. I believe he was quite well off.

And then?--", "characters": 17, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could find--first a small shop, then a small school, and so on.

What a relief you must feel if--", "characters": 38, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to live for anymore. (Gets up restlessly.)

If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work of some kind--", "characters": 365, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Nora.

Oh, don't be angry with me!", "characters": 42, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde (going up to her). It is you that must not be angry with me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish.

How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald could get you something to do.", "characters": 102, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. Yes, that was what I was thinking of.", "characters": 49, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. He must, Christine.

I know so little of them?", "characters": 36, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde (smiling). My dear!

Do you suppose I didn't try, first of all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry, Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices--as I believe he called them.

It has been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually. I may tell you that there is something that is called, in business, quarterly interest, and another thing called payment in installments, and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them. I have had to save a little here and there, where I could, you understand. I have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for Torvald must have a good table.

My goodness, it's delightful to think of, Christine! Free from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free from care; to be able to play and romp with the children; to be able to keep the house beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes it!

Then it really isn't he?", "characters": 36, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for a moment.

I should not be a man if this womanly helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes.

It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me to assure you that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that I have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life, so to speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him.

What sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage?", "characters": 69, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora (undisturbed). I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste, and so I got the same tastes as your else I pretended to, I am really not quite sure which--I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here like a poor woman--just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa have committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have made nothing of my life.", "characters": 584, "sentences": 9}, {"text": "Helmer. How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you not been happy here?", "characters": 88, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never really been so.", "characters": 84, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer. Not--not happy!", "characters": 23, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage has been, Torvald.", "characters": 370, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Helmer. There is some truth in what you say--exaggerated and strained as your view of it is. But for the future it shall be different. Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.", "characters": 187, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. Whose lessons? Mine, or the children's?", "characters": 45, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Helmer. Both yours and the children's, my darling Nora.", "characters": 55, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being a proper wife for you.", "characters": 88, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. And you can say that!", "characters": 29, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. And I--how am I fitted to bring up the children?", "characters": 54, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Helmer. Nora!", "characters": 13, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. Didn't you say so yourself a little while ago--that you dare not trust me to bring them up?", "characters": 97, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Helmer. In a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?", "characters": 62, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task. There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and educate myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that for myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.", "characters": 255, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Helmer (springing up). What do you say?", "characters": 39, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and everything about me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you any longer.", "characters": 149, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer. Nora, Nora!", "characters": 19, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I am going away from here now, at once.

I forbid you!", "characters": 65, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or later.", "characters": 148, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Helmer. What sort of madness is this!", "characters": 37, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean, to my old home. It will be easiest for me to find something to do there.", "characters": 112, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer. You blind, foolish woman!", "characters": 33, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I must try and get some sense, Torvald.", "characters": 45, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. To desert your home, your husband and your children! And you don't consider what people will say!", "characters": 105, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I cannot consider that at all.

I have other duties just as sacred.", "characters": 41, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. That you have not. What duties could those be?", "characters": 54, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Duties to myself.", "characters": 23, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. Before all else, you are a wife and a mother.", "characters": 53, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. I don't believe that any longer. I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being, just as you are--or, at all events, that I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people would think you right, and that views of that kind are to be found in books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get to understand them.", "characters": 448, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Helmer. Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have you not a reliable guide in such matters as that?--have you no religion?", "characters": 137, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.", "characters": 67, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. What are you saying?", "characters": 28, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other. When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that matter too.

The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that you and I look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too, that the law is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it impossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her husband's life. I can't believe that.", "characters": 456, "sentences": 9}, {"text": "Helmer. You talk like a child. You don't understand the conditions of the world in which you live.", "characters": 98, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I can make out who is right, the world or I.", "characters": 111, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Helmer. You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are out of your mind.", "characters": 86, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. I have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight.", "characters": 64, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer.

Yes, it is.", "characters": 17, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. Then there is only one possible explanation.", "characters": 52, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora.

I do not love you any more.", "characters": 128, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer (regaining his composure).

And can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?", "characters": 66, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight, when the wonderful thing did not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you were.", "characters": 137, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer. Explain yourself better. I don't understand you.", "characters": 56, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. I have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness knows, I knew very well that wonderful things don't happen every day. Then this horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad's letter was lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would consent to accept this man's conditions. I was so absolutely certain that you would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And when that was done--", "characters": 512, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Helmer. Yes, what then?--when I had exposed my wife to shame and disgrace?", "characters": 74, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora.

Nora--!", "characters": 15, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your part? No, of course not.

I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora--bear sorrow and want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he loves.", "characters": 152, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.", "characters": 61, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. Oh, you think and talk like a heedless child.", "characters": 53, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind myself to. As soon as your fear was over--and it was not fear for what threatened me, but for what might happen to you--when the whole thing was past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care, because it was so brittle and fragile. (Getting up.) Torvald--it was then it dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a strange man, and had borne him three children--. Oh, I can't bear to think of it!

I have heard that when a wife deserts her husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all obligations towards her. In any case, I set you free from all your obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way, any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. See, here is your ring back.
