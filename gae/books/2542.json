Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has opened the door.)", "characters": 392, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. (To the PORTER, taking out her purse.) How much?", "characters": 171, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. There is a shilling. No, keep the change. (The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband's door and listens.) Yes, he is in. (Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.)", "characters": 363, "sentences": 10}, {"text": "Nora. Just now. (Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.)

Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.", "characters": 140, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly. Nora. Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn't we? Just a tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of money.", "characters": 216, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Helmer. Nora! (Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.) The same little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today, and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year's Eve a slate fell on my head and killed me, and--Nora (putting her hands over his mouth). Oh! don't say such horrid things.", "characters": 335, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Helmer. That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt.

Do you think I don't know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?", "characters": 129, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora (counting). Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.", "characters": 124, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly's bedstead for Emmy,--they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids; old Anne ought really to have something better.", "characters": 398, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Helmer. Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what would you like for yourself?", "characters": 100, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora (playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his). If you really want to give me something, you might--you might--", "characters": 138, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora (speaking quickly). You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as much as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something with it.", "characters": 152, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn't that be fun?", "characters": 150, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Spendthrifts--I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then I shall have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very sensible plan, isn't it?", "characters": 165, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer (smiling). Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to save out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for yourself.

You can't deny it, my dear little Nora. (Puts his arm round her waist.) It's a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of money.

You haven't any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.", "characters": 115, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.", "characters": 336, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Helmer. And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet little skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking rather--what shall I say--rather uneasy today?", "characters": 195, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word-- (Going up to her.) Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They will all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt.", "characters": 218, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Helmer. No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come to dinner with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning. I have ordered some good wine. Nora, you can't think how I am looking forward to this evening.", "characters": 237, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Helmer. It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment, and a big enough income. It's delightful to think of, isn't it?", "characters": 137, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight, making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever spent!", "characters": 285, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I help the cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?", "characters": 120, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Helmer. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good thing that our hard times are over.", "characters": 178, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Helmer. This time I needn't sit here and be dull all alone, and you needn't ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands--", "characters": 126, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora (clapping her hands). No, Torvald, I needn't any longer, need I! It's wonderfully lovely to hear you say so! (Taking his arm.) Now I will tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrange things, Torvald.

What a nuisance!", "characters": 368, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "(HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers in Mrs. LINDE, who is in travelling dress, and shuts the door.)

And yet how could I--(In a gentle voice.) How you have altered, Christine!", "characters": 127, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come into the town, and have taken this long journey in winter--that was plucky of you.", "characters": 226, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful! We will have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold, I hope. (Helps her.) Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy. No, take this armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. (Takes her hands.) Now you look like your old self again; it was only the first moment--You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.", "characters": 428, "sentences": 10}, {"text": "Nora. Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much. (Stops suddenly and speaks seriously.) What a thoughtless creature I am, chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.", "characters": 208, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Nora. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off and something always prevented me.", "characters": 177, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have suffered. And he left you nothing?", "characters": 104, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad that must be. I have three lovely children. You can't see them just now, for they are out with their nurse. But now you must tell me all about it.", "characters": 195, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Nora. No, you must begin. I mustn't be selfish today; today I must only think of your affairs. But there is one thing I must tell you. Do you know we have just had a great piece of good luck?", "characters": 191, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde (smiling). Nora, Nora, haven't you learned sense yet? In our schooldays you were a great spendthrift.", "characters": 112, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora (laughing). Yes, that is what Torvald says now. (Wags her finger at her.) But \"Nora, Nora\" is not so silly as you think. We have not been in a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.", "characters": 205, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Nora. Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's life. But it cost a tremendous lot of money, Christine.", "characters": 241, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Nora. Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn't go and nurse him. I was expecting little Ivar's birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald to look after. My dear, kind father--I never saw him again, Christine. That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.", "characters": 269, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Nora. Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our going, so we started a month later.", "characters": 105, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless, and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I was justified in refusing his offer.", "characters": 177, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. I believe he was quite well off. But his business was a precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was nothing left.", "characters": 152, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could find--first a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three years have seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end, Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the boys do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for themselves.", "characters": 359, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to live for anymore. (Gets up restlessly.) That was why I could not stand the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts. If only I could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work of some kind--", "characters": 365, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Nora. But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look tired out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.", "characters": 131, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde (going up to her). It is you that must not be angry with me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of the happy turn your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe it--I was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.", "characters": 410, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Nora. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald could get you something to do.", "characters": 102, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject very cleverly--I will think of something that will please him very much. It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.", "characters": 196, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is doubly kind in you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles of life.", "characters": 150, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde (smiling). My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!--You are a child, Nora.", "characters": 100, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. You are just like the others. They all think that I am incapable of anything really serious--", "characters": 99, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. You look down upon me altogether, Christine--but you ought not to. You are proud, aren't you, of having worked so hard and so long for your mother?", "characters": 153, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. Indeed, I don't look down on anyone. But it is true that I am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end of my mother's life almost free from care.", "characters": 183, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn't on any account--no one in the world must know, Christine, except you.", "characters": 127, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. Come here. (Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.) Now I will show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who saved Torvald's life.", "characters": 163, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Nora. I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have recovered if he had not gone there--", "characters": 103, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. But where did you get it from, then? Nora (humming and smiling with an air of mystery). Hm, hm! Aha!", "characters": 112, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora (tossing her head). Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for business--a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--", "characters": 126, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the money. I may have got it some other way. (Lies back on the sofa.) Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive as I am--", "characters": 213, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Mrs. Linde. And did your husband never get to know from your father that the money had not come from him?", "characters": 105, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.", "characters": 184, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Nora. Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.", "characters": 339, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever Torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things, I have never spent more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and so Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me, Christine--because it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn't it?", "characters": 411, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Nora. Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I was desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to sit there working and earning money. It was like being a man.", "characters": 347, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Nora. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits' end. (Smiles.) Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen in love with me--", "characters": 322, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Nora. Be quiet!--that he had died; and that when his will was opened it contained, written in big letters, the instruction: \"The lovely Mrs. Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at once in cash.\"", "characters": 212, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Servant (at the hall door). Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman to see the master, and as the doctor is with him--", "characters": 117, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Krogstad (at the door). It is I, Mrs. Helmer.

What do you want to see my husband about?", "characters": 128, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Krogstad. Bank business--in a way. I have a small post in the Bank, and I hear your husband is to be our chief now--", "characters": 116, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Be so good as to go into the study, then. (She bows indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up the fire in the stove.)", "characters": 165, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. With several children. There now, it is burning up. (Shuts the door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside.)", "characters": 122, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know anything about it. But don't let us think of business; it is so tiresome.", "characters": 117, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Doctor Rank (comes out of HELMER'S study. Before he shuts the door he calls to him). No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would rather go in to your wife for a little while. (Shuts the door and sees Mrs. LINDE.) I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.", "characters": 273, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Rank. I have often heard Mrs. Linde's name mentioned here. I think I passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs. Linde?", "characters": 121, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Rank. Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to amuse yourself with our entertainments?", "characters": 109, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Rank. Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case too, is at this very moment with Helmer--", "characters": 238, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Rank. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don't know at all. He suffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs. Helmer; but even he began talking of its being highly important that he should live.", "characters": 205, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Rank. Yes, he has some sort of appointment there. (To Mrs. LINDE.) I don't know whether you find also in your part of the world that there are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral corruption, and, as soon as they have found some, put the person concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on him. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.", "characters": 392, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Rank (shrugging his shoulders). Yes, there you are. That is the sentiment that is turning Society into a sick-house.", "characters": 116, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "(NORA, who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into smothered laughter and claps her hands.)", "characters": 102, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. What do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at something quite different, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are all the people who are employed in the Bank dependent on Torvald now?", "characters": 213, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora (smiling and humming). That's my affair! (Walking about the room.) It's perfectly glorious to think that we have--that Torvald has so much power over so many people. (Takes the packet from her pocket.) Doctor Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?", "characters": 250, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You couldn't know that Torvald had forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so, isn't it, Doctor Rank? By your leave! (Puts a macaroon into his mouth.) You must have one too, Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one--or at most two. (Walking about.) I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in the world now that I should dearly love to do.", "characters": 460, "sentences": 10}, {"text": "Rank. Well, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you might. What is it you would so much like to say if Torvald could hear you?", "characters": 140, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora (hiding the packet). Hush! Hush! Hush!

And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the Bank--the news was telegraphed, you know--she travelled here as quick as she could. Torvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for Christine, for my sake, won't you?", "characters": 237, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Rank. Wait a minute; I will come with you.

You want to speak to me?", "characters": 262, "sentences": 7}, {"text": "Krogstad. No, it is Christmas Eve, and it will depend on yourself what sort of a Christmas you will spend.", "characters": 106, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Krogstad. We won't talk about that until later on. This is something different. I presume you can give me a moment?", "characters": 115, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Krogstad. Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I can ask you, without beating about the bush--is Mrs. Linde to have an appointment in the Bank?", "characters": 165, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of my husband's subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs. Linde is to have an appointment.

Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come when I should advise you to use your influence to prevent that.", "characters": 131, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I! What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with my husband?", "characters": 147, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Krogstad.

Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and you were so anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid no attention to the conditions of our bargain.

No, it was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.", "characters": 123, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. It was impossible; papa was so ill.

You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my part. It really is so--of course it is! (Sits down in the rocking-chair, and looks at him with a smile.) You are a nice sort of man, Doctor Rank!--don't you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?", "characters": 345, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Nora. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as before. You know very well Torvald can't do without you.", "characters": 126, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Rank. It is just that, that put me on the wrong track.

Was it likely that I would be continually and forever telling you about worries that you could not help me to bear?", "characters": 123, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I am not speaking about business matters. I say that we have never sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything.", "characters": 143, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. That is just it; you have never understood me. I have been greatly wronged, Torvald--first by papa and then by you.", "characters": 121, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora (shaking her head). You have never loved me. You have only thought it pleasant to be in love with me.", "characters": 106, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with papa, he told me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinions; and if I differed from him I concealed the fact, because he would not have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he played with me just as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to live with you--", "characters": 348, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage has been, Torvald.", "characters": 370, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Helmer. There is some truth in what you say--exaggerated and strained as your view of it is. But for the future it shall be different. Playtime shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.", "characters": 187, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task. There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and educate myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that for myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.", "characters": 255, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Nora. I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and everything about me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you any longer.", "characters": 149, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or later.", "characters": 148, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean, to my old home. It will be easiest for me to find something to do there.", "characters": 112, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer. To desert your home, your husband and your children! And you don't consider what people will say!", "characters": 105, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I don't believe that any longer. I believe that before all else I am a reasonable human being, just as you are--or, at all events, that I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people would think you right, and that views of that kind are to be found in books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get to understand them.", "characters": 448, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Helmer. Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have you not a reliable guide in such matters as that?--have you no religion?", "characters": 137, "sentences": 2}, {"text": "Nora. I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other. When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that matter too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all events if it is true for me.", "characters": 302, "sentences": 6}, {"text": "Helmer. This is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion cannot lead you aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose you have some moral sense? Or--answer me--am I to think you have none?", "characters": 209, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to answer. I really don't know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that you and I look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too, that the law is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it impossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her husband's life. I can't believe that.", "characters": 456, "sentences": 9}, {"text": "Nora. No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I can make out who is right, the world or I.", "characters": 111, "sentences": 5}, {"text": "Nora. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been so kind to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.", "characters": 128, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight, when the wonderful thing did not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you were.", "characters": 137, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora. When that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would come forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.", "characters": 142, "sentences": 3}, {"text": "Nora. You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your part? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been worth against yours? That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to kill myself.", "characters": 274, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer. I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora--bear sorrow and want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he loves.", "characters": 152, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer (sadly). I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us--there is no denying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?", "characters": 136, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora (going out to the right). That makes it all the more certain that it must be done. (She comes back with her cloak and hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table.)", "characters": 183, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Nora (putting on her hat). You know very well that would not last long. (Puts the shawl round her.) Goodbye, Torvald. I won't see the little ones. I know they are in better hands than mine. As I am now, I can be of no use to them.", "characters": 230, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Nora. Listen, Torvald. I have heard that when a wife deserts her husband's house, as I am doing now, he is legally freed from all obligations towards her. In any case, I set you free from all your obligations. You are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way, any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. See, here is your ring back. Give me mine.", "characters": 377, "sentences": 9}, {"text": "Nora. That's right. Now it is all over. I have put the keys here. The maids know all about everything in the house--better than I do. Tomorrow, after I have left her, Christine will come here and pack up my own things that I brought with me from home. I will have them sent after me.", "characters": 283, "sentences": 8}, {"text": "Nora. Both you and I would have to be so changed that--. Oh, Torvald, I don't believe any longer in wonderful things happening.", "characters": 127, "sentences": 4}, {"text": "Helmer (sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands).
